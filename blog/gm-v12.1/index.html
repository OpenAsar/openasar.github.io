    <h2 id="goosemod-v121-is-now-out-various-improvements-with-store-ui-storage-settings-and-more"><strong>GooseMod v12.1</strong> is now out! Various improvements with Store UI, storage, settings, and more.</h2>
<h3 id="store">Store</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ludicrous speed.</strong> The Store should now be quite faster, especially on low-end hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Carousel controls in banner images.</strong> Also made modal opening more obvious via cursor.</li>
<li><strong>Search text hints.</strong> Now shows no results text for no results, and hints to go to an other category if there are results in that and not the current category.</li>
<li><strong>Improved profile store.</strong> Better and more reliable scrolling down to card and now highlight clears after a short time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="parity-storage">Parity Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy reduction in GooseMod wipes / resets.</strong> Sometimes when Discord updates (desktop) GooseMod settings and modules would get cleared due to a Discord client bug. This should now hopefully be eliminated or at least heavily reduced thanks to a new parity storage backup system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tweaks-settings">Tweaks Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Added tweaks setting section.</strong> Includes new minor changes you can now toggle on or off. New settings (and more will likely be added in future updates):</li>
<li><strong>Placeholder Image.</strong> Use a placeholder image in the Store for modules without images.</li>
<li><strong>Collapsible Home Category.</strong> Let home category be collapsible via icon.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Added new setting to give notifications when new modules are added to the Store.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Headers are now not collapsible by default.</strong> Now has to be turned on for individual headers. The experimental section is also now collapsed by default.</li>
<li><strong>Rewrote settings context (right click) menu to use ids.</strong> Should no longer open wrong tabs if named the same.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="themeability">Themeability</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Various minor additions to allow for easier theming.</strong> We introduced a variety of small tweaks to help make some of GooseMod easier to theme for theme developers:</li>
<li><strong>GooseMod settings sidebar items now have easier ids to grab.</strong> Used to just use label so was reliant on supporting all translations.</li>
<li><strong>Added GooseMod class to body so themes know if it&rsquo;s in use.</strong></li>
</ul>
