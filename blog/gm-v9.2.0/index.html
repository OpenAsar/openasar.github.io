<h3 id="backup-system">Backup System</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New backup system.</strong> There is a new backup system in GooseMod settings allowing you to backup your modules and settings. Backing up produces a backup file which you can then use to restore later on.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="store-improvements">Store Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ludicrous speed.</strong> Clicking on home items is now significantly faster than before.</li>
<li><strong>Squashed bugs.</strong> A bug causing Store pages to load forever has been fixed, as well as some rare crashes. Store in Settings is also now up and working again.</li>
<li><strong>Better sorting and filtering.</strong> Options are now properly shown and applied after going off and back to Store pages.</li>
</ul>
