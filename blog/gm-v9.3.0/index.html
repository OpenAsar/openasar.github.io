<h3 id="repos-improvements">Repos Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>More reliable modal.</strong> Repos which fail to load now show up so you can remove / disable them.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified internals.</strong> Mostly a pro for us, repos are now easier to work with and simpler internally in GooseMod.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="store-improvements">Store Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loading is more reliable.</strong> Most bugs for being stuck in loading have been fixed, apologies for any issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-debug-setting">New Debug Setting</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debug toasts have been added.</strong> You likely won&rsquo;t need them, but debug toasts have been added. This setting shows some toasts on certain events for insights into internal code.</li>
</ul>
