Now shows no results text for no results, and hints to go to an other category if there are results in that and not the current category.</description>

      <description>GooseMod v12.0 is now out! Better translations, store improvements, and more. Translations GooseMod now supports almost entire translations.

Store Decreased data usage and improved performance of Store pages. Images (banners, profile pictures) are now lazy loaded, meaning they are only loaded when visible.</description>

      <description>GooseMod v10.2 has been released! Features PGP verification for repos, plus some settings and API improvements. PGP Verification Repos now have PGP verification support. Repos can now be signed by their maintainers and verified within GooseMod. This should both improve security generally and for some specific attacks. The main advantage PGP adds is that it verifies repos are made and released by their owners. This prevents someone else taking over and publishing malicious updates as the repo would have to be signed with the same private key, which they should not have access to.</description>

      <description>GooseMod v10.0.0 has been released! Features a new storage system and rewritten injection for desktop resulting in faster and lighter injection. Storage New storage system. GooseMod now uses WebExtension storage for storing GooseMod preferences, installed modules, cache, etc. This should make storing more reliable, secure, and generally better. Desktop Using Extension GooseMod for desktop clients now uses the GooseMod for Web extension internally. This simplifies code (avoiding reuse / complications) and should result in faster (~50%) and lighter injection.</description>

      <description>GooseMod v9.0.0 has been released! React settings at long last! React Settings It&amp;rsquo;s finally here: React settings. Long requested by some, it&amp;rsquo;s finally done. We rewrote essentially over 2.5 thousand lines of JS so now our settings are made using React (instead of DOM which it used to use). What this means for you: More fitting UI. GooseMod&amp;rsquo;s settings are now even more fitting with Discord&amp;rsquo;s, now featuring animations, new colors, and finer looking items, making it now more seamless than ever.</description>
